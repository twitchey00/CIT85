    <h3 class="about">About</h3>

    <p class="about"> Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large,
        agile, muscular
        dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is
        truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when
        viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a
        free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why
        German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is
        character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to
        put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast
        guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and
        indiscriminate friendships.'</p>
        <h3> Activity </h3>
    <p>As a very active and athletic breed, the German Shepherd requires lots of exercise for his physical and mental
        well-being. A dog who is not exercised enough will become frustrated and likely to develop undesirable
        behaviors. With a puppy, you can start with short daily walks, as well as play sessions in a safely fenced area.
        Remember to not let the dog off leash, as even the best-trained dog can become distracted and not follow every
        command. Participating in canine activities such as agility, herding, tracking, and dock diving provides
        excellent physical and mental exercise and is fun and rewarding for both dog and owner.</p>
