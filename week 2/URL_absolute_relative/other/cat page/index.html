<h1>The Maine Coon Cat</h1>

<img src="../cat page/Maine_Coon.jpg">

    <div>The Maine Coon cat evolved through nature’s own breeding program developing characteristics by following a
        “survival of the fittest” evolution. The characteristics all have a purpose or function. Maine Coon cats
        developed into sturdy, working cats suited to the harsh winters and varied seasons of the Northeast region. The
        Maine Coon Cat of today is known for a sturdy, rugged appearance, which includes an uneven, shaggy coat of three
        distinct lengths and a long, well furnished tail. They carry that tail proudly and use it to surround themselves
        for warmth and protection. A Maine Coon Cat has large, well tufted paws to allow ability to walk on top of snow
        despite size and weight. Ears are large and well tufted for protection and warmth. Even more than for beauty,
        Maine Coon Cats are noted for intelligence and kindly disposition. After all, what they couldn’t obtain
        themselves, they could always get by charming a nearby human. Though their size can be intimidating, they are
        known for their friendliness towards just about anything and are especially good with children and other pets.
        For these reasons, they have been dubbed the “Gentle Giant” of the cat fancy and are commonly sought after as
        family pets, companions, and therapy cats.</div>
