    <h1 class="title">APGAR Score</h1>

    <p class="intro"> APGAR is a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score
        determines how well
        the baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score tells the health care provider how well the baby is
        doing outside the mother's womb.

        In rare cases, the test may be repeated later if the initial score is low.
        A score of 3, may indicate neurological damage. A healthy, thriving baby will score anywhere from 8-10.
        <br> <br>
        Virginia Apgar, MD (1909-1974) introduced the Apgar score in 1952.

    <h4>What Does My Baby's Score Mean?</h4>

<div id="last">
    <p>A baby who scores a 7 or above on the test is considered in good health. A lower score does not mean that your
        baby is unhealthy. It means that your baby may need some immediate medical care, such as suctioning of the
        airways or oxygen to help him or her breathe better. Perfectly healthy babies sometimes have a lower-than-usual
        score, especially in the first few minutes after birth.</p>
