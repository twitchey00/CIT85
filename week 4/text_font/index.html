    <h1>Orcas (Orcinus orca)</h1>

    <div class="Orcinus">Orcas (Orcinus orca) are often called killer whales, even though they almost never attack
        humans. In fact, the
        killer whale name was originally "whale killer," as ancient sailors saw them hunting in groups to take down
        large whales, according to Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC).

        Today, orcas are recognized as among the most widely distributed mammals on the planet, occupying every ocean.
        They are incredibly social, diverse and ferocious marine predators with a diet ranging from penguins to great
        white sharks. </div>

        No animals hunt orcas (except for humans). Killer whales
        feed on many different types of prey, including fish, seals, sea birds and squid. They can also take down whales
        larger than themselves, such as minke whales, and they are the only animal known to predate on great white
        sharks, according to The Natural History Museum in London. Killer whales have even been reported to kill
        swimming deer and moose, according to a chapter on orcas in "Primates and Cetaceans" (Springer, 2014).

        Orcas use many different techniques to catch prey. Sometimes they beach themselves to catch seals on land,
        jumping from the water onto land. Orcas will also work together to catch larger prey or groups of prey, such as
        schools of fish, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. 
        They can use echolocation to identify their prey by creating sounds, or sound waves, that travel through the water. 
        These waves echo off objects, including prey, which the orcas can use to locate them, according to<div class="seaworld">SeaWorld.</div>
